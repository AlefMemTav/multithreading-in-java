# Multithreading in Java
This repository contains examples and exercises related to the Thread and Concurrency in Java. The code is based on the multithreading lessons from the DevDojo Academy training, which were taught by William Suane, a Lead Java Consultant at Devoteam in 2023, and Rinaldo Pitzer, a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat in 2023.

# Getting Started
To run the examples in this repository, you should have a basic understanding of Java programming and multithreading concepts.
